## 
Hello!👋 I’m currently learning how to work with medical data and slowly building my understanding of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) development.  
I’m pursuing a 🌱Master’s degree in Archival Science in Chungnam National University (Republic of Korea)🌱, and ⚡my recent work experience involves patent and M&A tracking⚡ ( you can see my LinkedIn for details🔭 ).

What truly interests me is understanding How Hospital-Data flows and How it can be structured to solve Real World Problems especially #senior health, #senior wellness and so on.  
Rather than focusing on just writing code, I’m more interested in how data connects with workflows and decision-making processes. 
My GitHub repositories reflect this learning journey — structured as practical exercises in problem-solving and system thinking!😄

Fun Facts ! about me:
🎬 I’m a CINEPHILE who regularly visits local cinematheques. (Recently, I’ve been enjoying classic Japanese films at home with a projector!)  
🎶 I’m also an OPERA enthusiast, especially fond of Maria Callas. My favorite opera is "Rigoletto", and my favorite aria is "Casta Diva". I used to sing in a choir until last year.  
🧘‍♀️ I practice YOGA daily and am passionate about mindfulness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
